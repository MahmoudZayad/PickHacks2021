This shit seem automatic, I have, I ain't into
You don't really want me now
You know there's always someone else
You did it to me like you've played this game

You don't wanna fling, bring that ass over here
Boy, feelin' like a contest, how you wanna stare
Your attention span prolly long as your hair, too
If you're true, why you gotta dare, boo?
Some win and some gotta lose
You really need love, two L's, no cool
It is not me, nor them, just you
Acting like a fiend and the perp gon' shoot
Act seventeen when you're thirty-two
Pussy too clean and it purty too
So I can't intervene on your escapades
'Cause I ain't really tryna be the next to pay
And be the next to say, "I got an ex today"

Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me
You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player, I don't think I'ma play with you, uh-uh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm tryin' to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?

I'm sick of chillin', sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we needed more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom, I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right, pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines, bein' shy just ain't my style, now
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm trying to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?

Buddy, you ain't shit, eat a laxative
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
That's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so
Logical thinkin' is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for? Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole
I'm not your mommy, nigga
Find a new hobby, nigga
I towed your fucking pickup
Your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car
Or call your fuckin' mom
You should have paid my rent
Go get a fucking job
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib

All this money on me
It don't mean nothing
See it in your dreams
I just spend it all on my team, now we go
Oh-yay-ayy-ayy
We gettin paid e'day-ayy
We're just gettin' by
Savin' on the side
I just can't believe
I got what I wanted all my life, now we go
Oh-yay-ayy-ayy
We getting paid e'day-ayy
Say every-We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight 
And we cuddle, sure I do love it
But I need your lips on mine
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way we move, uh-oh
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it 
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it 
I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could bе corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I like to say, "What if?", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Thеn I might be onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way we move, uh-oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it 
Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All you niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real 
Drama make you feel 
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way we move, uh-oh

Trust me when I meet him, I'm fucking him on sight 
Lemme see you beat it, I'm feelin' just like Mike 
Huh, oh, surf that 'til I drown in all of your pics
Can't scroll down 'cause some of them dicks

Tell me, what must I do? 
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is
Take it off, follow me now, let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me
You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player, I don't think I'ma play with you, uh-uh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm tryin' to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me
I'm sick of chillin', sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we needed more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom, I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right, pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines, bein' shy just ain't my style, now
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm trying to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me
If you wanna be the one
Don't act sad and wait
And waste my day
I'm not that way
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Spend your life with me
Pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for meCan I get to know you babe?

Now it's the one to throw it back with it
Fittin' all that, he ain't gotta call back
Trippin' this, prison this, nigga I don't get it, I'm addicted
Reading all my feelings, need a one-way ticket
Looking so fly 'cause I mind my business
Self-proposed but you know I'm vicious
Slow your roll, you can't lie to me, baby

Want these knees to go opposite ways
And I see you fiendin', go off on it, babe

But I got niggas in my city and my bitches is cold, so
